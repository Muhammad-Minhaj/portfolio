  "description": "This project encompasses three key components:\n\n- **Backend**: I developed the entire backend using Express.js, Node.js, and Mongoose. This robust backend handles data management, authentication, and API functionalities.\n\n- **Website Front-End**: The public-facing website, designed for publishing medical-related articles, was built using React.js, TailwindCSS, and Next.js. It offers a modern and responsive interface for users to easily navigate and read content.\n\n- **Admin Front-End**: I implemented an article management system for the admin panel, enabling efficient content, category, and navigation management. The admin interface also supports file uploads, newsletter subscriber management, and email notifications for new articles. Authentication features were integrated into both the backend and the admin front-end to ensure secure access.\n\nThis solution provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for both visitors and administrators, catering specifically to the needs of managing and displaying medical content.",
